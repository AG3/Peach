TODO list:
Manager server give Connector server a port to listen.
Every connector server have different log file.
Decide which server will setup auth service,connector or logic(I prefer in logic server,maybe it should be).
Channel service will setup by connector server, every channel boardcast will send to every connector server.(too much extra tcp connection?)
Peach should be CRASH-ONLY!(add panic to function checkError)
